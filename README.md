Good morning,

If you receive this  email it means that you've been selected to carry on my the development of my new (amazing)
Web Platform.

I had this Idea back in Hign school, but never had means to  carry it out.

BookFace, "A place where friends can reconnect".

It's quite a simple application but i know it has the power of changing the world.

The idea: When someone registers to the app, they can create a "Profile", then they can go to what I will call, their "floors", wich is a place where a user can post what they think, what they do, maybe a picture of them...

Then, they can use the space bar, to search for other persons using Bookface and check out what they posted on their floors.

I'm sure you are up for the task. you and I will shape the future together!

Zack Trurenberck.
